# What is this?

Thank you for visiting our repository, basically the repository is a project for the SM4 version of Picnic V3.0 post quantum digital signature. We replace the LowMC block cipher component of Picnic signature and replace it with China's commercial block cipher standard : SM4

We applied our attempt on FPGA platform and the repository contains enough information to run it successfully
